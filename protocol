The following is a description of the protocol used for communication
between monitor and agents.  The networking protocol is IP, and due to
the nature of IP (it doesn't preserve message boundaries) the following
lists what constitues a full (complete) message.

The message consist of mearly strings of text.  Precisly 4 bytes in length,
counting the terminating character which is a single '0'.  The strings are
as follow:

Trasmissions sent by Monitor (server side):

Trasmission String		Meaning
:->0				hello
:-(0				utility power lost
:-)0				utility power restored
:-|0				Administrative shutdown of monitor
;->0				routine comm between monitor to agent
				*Note currently, unimplemented

Trasmissions sent by Agent (client side):
:-)0				Positive acknowledgment
:-(0				Negative acknowledgment, resend data
