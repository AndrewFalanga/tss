Hello, welcome to my little web page to view source code that I've written!!!
</p>

<p align="center">
This page isn't really anything special.  In fact, the source code is plain text files.  You must use your browsers "Back" button to get back here.  Enjoy <B> Also, I'm going to be out of work very quickly here.  If you like what you see, or you think I've got potential (which I do) please let me know of any employment possibilities.  My e-mail address is ExcaliburAF@netscape.net.
